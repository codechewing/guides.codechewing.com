# HTML5 doctype keyboard shortcut using Emmet

When creating a new HTML document, there's always that sluggish start before you
should begin; Getting the boilerplate/skeleton of the HTML structure out of the way.
You'll need something like this HTML before you can begin:

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

This mundane task (some may enjoy it...) can be almost completely eliminated with
the use of a handy HTML5 doctype shortcut (once you have the **Emmet plugin**
installed).

## How to use the Emmet HTML5 doctype shortcut

Save the blank document as an HTML file (so Emmet can actually identify the shortcut),
and type <kbd>html:5</kbd> followed by <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> (**Coda / Eclipse**) OR
<kbd>tab</kbd> (**Sublime Text 2**) OR whatever the trigger is inside of your IDE for
expanding Emmet shortcut codes:

```
html:5
```

### Sublime Text 3 / JetBrains

With Sublime Text 3 or a JetBrains based IDE (like WebStorm, IntelliJ, PHPStorm, etc.),
you can simply use an exclamation mark (<kbd>!</kbd>) followed by a <kbd>tab</kbd>:

```
!
```

Check to see if your
[IDE supports Emmet](https://emmet.io/download/)(rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank")
